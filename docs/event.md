## Description

The `event` product contains commands to trigger mock events for local webhook testing or migration.

## Trigger

Used to either create or send mock events for use with local webhooks testing.

**Args**

twitch event trigger cheer -f 1234 -t 4567 // generates JSON for a cheer event from user 1234 to user 4567
```

## Retrigger

Allows previous events to be refired based on the event ID. The ID is noted within the event itself, such as in the "subscription" payload of standard webhooks.

For example, for:

```json
{
  "subscription": {
    "id": "713f3254-0178-9757-7439-d779400c0999",
    "type": "channels.cheer",
    ...
  }
}
```

The resulting ID would be `713f3254-0178-9757-7439-d779400c0999`.
